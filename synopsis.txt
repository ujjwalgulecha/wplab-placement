This project aims to solve the placement process troubles in R V College of Engineering.
Placement process in RVCE takes place throughout the year, and the process of communication between coordinators and participants about
 the upcoming activities has many drawbacks. Remembering details about visiting and visited companies and other statistics for a student
is tedious and not organized. In this project we are building a web application which manages the operations which will ease some
placement processes such as registering for the company, viewing the shortlist and so on. 
The placement coordinators upload any information regarding upcoming placement activities and the students can register for them. 
The students can view details and statistics  of visiting companies. Placement records of previous years are also maintained by the website. 
The website also takes care about notifying the students by sending mails according the departments as they arrive. Options are provided
 for the coordinators to  send any further notifications to the participants  and also to edit the uploaded details of the companies. 
 The front end is designed to be appealing and user friendly. A Database is used for data storage.
